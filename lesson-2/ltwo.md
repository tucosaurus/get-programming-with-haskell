# functions must return a value

# All functions in Haskell follow three rules that force them to behave like functions in math:
1.  All functions must take an argument.
2.  All functions must return a value.
3.  Anytime a function is called with the same argument, it must return the same
value.

## 3rd rule is similiar to a mathematical definition of a function.

## 3rd rule is called referential transparency.

# Quick Check answers:
++ and += operator

If made as a function, they can indeed take in a value and return a value.
So it shouldnt matter.
They cannot be used as they are in C++ and with the same semantics but we should be able to have them as functions. 

# In haskell, all expressions must evaluate to a value
